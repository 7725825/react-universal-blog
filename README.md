#React Universal Blog
#####About
The React Universal Blog lets you have your cake and eat it too: it renders html on the server side to make it SEO friendly and after initial render, creates a single page application to allow for fast navigation between pages.

It uses the following:
<br>
1. [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) for UI views<br>
2. [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) for routing<br>
3. [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) for data flow<br>
4. [Cosmic JS](https://cosmicjs.com) for content management
